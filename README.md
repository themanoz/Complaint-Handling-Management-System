# Complaint-Handling-Management-System

A Complaint Handling Management System is a software application designed to help organizations manage and track customer complaints in a systematic and organized manner. This type of system can be used by a wide range of businesses, including government agencies, healthcare organizations, and retail companies.

The key features of a Complaint Handling Management System typically include:

1.Complaint registration: The system should allow users to register complaints easily and efficiently, either by phone, email, or web form.

2.Complaint tracking: Once a complaint has been registered, the system should allow users to track the status of the complaint and any actions taken to resolve it.

By implementing a Complaint Handling Management System, organizations can improve their response times to customer complaints, reduce the risk of complaints being lost or mishandled, and ultimately enhance their overall customer service experience.
